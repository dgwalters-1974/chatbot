# chatbot
A simple RAG chatbot. Integrates data from the attached .md files with its responses. App isn't available publically on Streamlit but you can launch it locally in the usual way - clone repo then 'streamlit run app.py' to run.

(Have had some compatibility issues with more recent versions of Python due to regex library - 3.9 works so stick with that)
